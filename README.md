# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

`Under Development`

## Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using a dataset that includes information on `age`, `sex`, `BMI`, `number of children`, `smoking status`, `region`, and `insurance costs`. By applying machine learning techniques, the goal is to build a model that accurately estimates insurance costs based on individuals' demographic and health characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- **age**: Age of the primary beneficiary
- **sex**: Insurance contractor gender, female or male
- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg/m²)
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by insurance
- **smoker**: Smoking status of the insurance contractor
- **region**: Residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Project Steps
### 1. 🔍 Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Handle missing values, if any, and perform data cleaning.
- Encode categorical variables such as `sex`, `smoker`, and `region`.

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of numerical variables (`age`, `BMI`, `charges`).
- Examine the relationships between variables using visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Identify correlations between features.

### 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Create new features if necessary to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.

### 4. 🤖 Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`).
- Train and evaluate multiple models to compare their performance.

### 5. 🧮 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the models using metrics such as `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`, `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`, and `R-squared (R²)`.
- Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

### 6. 🔧 Model Tuning and Optimization
- Fine-tune the selected model using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization.
- Re-evaluate the optimized model to ensure improved performance.

### 7. 🚀 Deployment and Prediction
- Save the final model for future use.
- Create a script or application that allows users to input new data and receive insurance cost predictions.

### 8. 📝 Documentation and Reporting
- Document the entire process, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- Create a final report or presentation summarizing the findings and results of the project.

## Requirements
